## INTRODUCTION

In this project, you will apply what you have learned in the course (e.g., github usage, C/C++ programming, etc.) and
**implement a text-based mini-game of your own choice**. A text-based game is a console application that can be
accessed using the Linux terminal and via SSH. Please pay attention to the project requirements, scope, and
submission details in this instruction. You have the flexibility to work on your own idea as long as your final program
comprises the element as set out in the code requirement below.

Please also notice the late submission and plagiarism policies available in the course information on Moodle.

## Milestones and Timeline

- Stage 1: Grouping (due: March 29, ~3 weeks from now)
- Stage 2: Project Product submission (due: May 3, ~8 weeks from now)
- Stage 3: Self-evaluation and Peer evaluation (due: May 4)

**Check what you need to submit and note carefully the specific requirements for the project.**

## Build Your Group

You must work in a group of 2 - 6 for the project. Please make sure that you have indicated your grouping on Moodle,
as some submissions would be done on a group basis on Moodle. Grouping cannot be changed after the grouping
deadline. You may make use of the Moodle forum to find project partners.

Please indicate your grouping on this Moodle page and have your project partners join the same group.


## Examples for Your Reference

There are several examples of text-based game available for your reference. You should not copy any code from the
Internet directly.

**Caveat: Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. Please ensure that all your project submissions are plagiarism-free,
or you risk losing all marks in the project. Please refer to "What is plagiarism?" - HKU T&L for the definition and
scope of plagiarism.**

- Honkonmon Go
- Blackjack
- Minesweeper

## REQUIREMENTS

- **Code Requirement:** Your implementation should include all the following coding elements:
    o Generation of random events
    o Data structures for storing data
    o Dynamic memory management
    o File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving data)
    o Program codes in multiple files
    o **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** The game should have more than one difficulty level, allowing the player
       to choose their preferred level.
- **Documentation and Code style:**
    o In-code documentation: For each function, comments on “what it does”, “what the inputs are”, and
       “what the outputs are” are needed.
    o Proper indentation and naming styles should be used to ensure readability and maintainability.
    o All project files should be committed to a private GitHub repo. Commit comments should not be
       empty and should be written sensibly.
    o **README.MD** : Include team members, application description, features, non-standard libraries, and
       compilation/execution instructions.
- **Contributions:** Each student should contribute certain added(+) lines of the code and documents to their
    project, gauged by GitHub’s “Contributors Graph”.
       o For a group of 2, each student should contribute at least 25%.
       o For a group of 3, each student should contribute at least 20%.
       o For a group of 4 - 6 , each student should contribute at least 10%.
       o If you have low contribution and fail to provide valid reasons, you will receive 0 mark for the project.
- You may use any C/C++ libraries that don't require any additional installation on the grader's side. That means
    the grader won't download any libraries from the internet for you, and your program will be considered not
    compliable because of missing dependencies. To use a library that requires additional installation, you
    should either put the necessary files from a library together with your code so that an additional installation
    is not needed, or you shouldn't use the library at all.
- You should make sure your code can be successfully compiled in the Computer Science department's
    academy server.


## Stage 1: Grouping

The purpose of this milestone is to help you define the project scope and consolidate your ideas before you start to
implement.

**What to do for this milestone:**

- To form a project group and indicate your group members as mentioned in the previous section.
- To identify a text-based game type that you would like to implement. Or design your own game.
- To decide what features your text-based game would have.
- To set up a private GitHub repo where your work will be hosted.

**What to do (by each group)**

- Set up a private Github repository that includes all group members and the teaching team account
    engg1340comp2113.
- You can refer to Inviting collaborators to a personal repository GitHub Docs for the procedure to add
    collaborators.
- The teaching team will accept the invitation within 7 days. If we fail to do so, please add again.

**Reference:**

- Getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub;
- About READMEs


## Stage 2: Project Product Submission

**What to do for this milestone:**

- To implement the application.
- To document your code.

**What to submit (by each group)**

- In the same Github repo that you set up in Stage 1.
    o Create a README.MD file in the repo that contains:
       ▪ Identification of the team members.
       ▪ A description of your game.
       ▪ A list of features that you **have implemented** and explain how each coding element 1 to 5 listed
          under the **coding requirements** aforementioned support your features.
       ▪ A list of non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work and integrated to your
          code repo. Please also indicate what features in your game are supported by these libraries.
       ▪ Compilation and execution instructions. This serves like a "Quick start" of your game. The
          teaching team will follow your instructions to compile and run your game.
    o Your code including **the makefile and all source files (.h / .cpp / .c)**
- Submit a link to the repo to Moodle. (Refer to the details on the submission page)
- A **video** (at most 3 minutes long) demonstrating the implemented features of your game.
    o You can either submit a link to the video or upload it to Moodle.
    o Video clips after 3 mins will be ignored if your demo is longer than 3 mins.

## Stage 3: Self-evaluation and Peer evaluation

**What to do for this milestone:**

- To help graders gain insights into each student's contribution.
- To give feedback on teammate’s contributions.
- To declare your contribution **with explanations** if the Contributions Graph in GitHub does not reflect the real
    contribution distribution.

**What to submit (by each individual student)**

- Submit on Moodle (Refer to the details on the submission page)
- A list of work that you have done for the project.
- A peer evaluation of your project partners in your group.
